 * xrayswarm - a shameless ripoff of the //swarm// screensaver on SGI
 *   boxes.
 *
 * Version 1.0 - initial release.  doesn//t read any special command-line
 *   options, and only supports the variable //delay// via Xresources.
 *   (the delay resouces is most useful on systems w/o gettimeofday, in
 *   which case automagical level-of-detail for FPS maintainance can//t
 *   be used.)
 *
 *   The code isn't commented, but isn't too ugly. It should be pretty
 *   easy to understand, with the exception of the colormap stuff.
